<p class="poem">The family have gone to the country,<br />
Horton, his wife and four children.<br />
They took the butler and maids, the dogs,<br />
The canaries and parrot. Shutters<br />
They put on the house and the keys<br />
Are turned in the locks. The silver<br />
Was put in the vault and everything<br />
Valuable carefully stowed....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Little Jack</span><br />
Looked well for me. But when he found me<br />
Was told to put me outside; a cat has no<br />
Place in a house that is closed for<br />
The summer.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">When they were sorely troubled</span><br />
With rats and mice they coaxed me to<br />
Come to live in the cellar. They fed<br />
Me richly on cream and the choicest<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Bits from their lavish table. They gave<br />
Me a rug to sleep, and taught the children<br />
To pet me. All took turns to feed me and<br />
They saved the bones of each fish.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">The</span><br />
Mice and rats disappeared; the rug<br />
Is filthy, in tatters. Old Horton curses<br />
And kicks me and kicks me down stairs when he<br />
Meets me; warns the baby to heed my<br />
Claws and the older children that<br />
Cats breed all sorts of diseases. Edith<br />
Has young men to call and “cannot abide<br />
The cat that is covered with ashes.”<br />
Only Jack remembers&mdash;which reminds me<br />
How well I was treated. I was young when<br />
They found me and now have grown wise in<br />
Their councils.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I have no food and no</span><br />
Lodging.</p>

<p class="poem">It’s more than a week since I’ve eaten<br />
And my bed is made in the gutter. Well-fed<br />
And beggars go by and their boots are<br />
All alike ready as soon as they spy me.<br />
Jack Horton went by with his father and<br />
Stooped to whisper his secret. Old Horton<br />
Jerked his arm and urged that he’d miss<br />
The train. So even railroad time<br />
Seems relentless as the procession<br />
Passes over and about me. Between buying<br />
A new suit for his party<br />
And his affection<br />
Even young Jack had no choice.<br />
Now I have to hunt<br />
And I’ve eaten a sparrow for breakfast.<br />
I ate with infinite relish<br />
Though I never ate one before;<br />
I was starved and the murder and crime<br />
Were lost in my terrible necessity.<br />
My depravity is beginning to wear....<br />
I shall wander down to the river....<br />
I have heard Jack’s father say:<br />
When a man falls so low as that<br />
He had better drown himself than&mdash;<br />
I’ve forgotten the rest; I cannot think<br />
In my present state of mind.</p>

<p class="poem">Arrived at the wharf there was not<br />
Another soul in sight ... except at the very end<br />
Where sat a most woebegone looking Tramp<br />
Smoking what was once a cigar<br />
Of price. Half smoked it had been thrust<br />
In the gutter at the theater-entrance<br />
By a careless and prosperous merchant.<br />
The Tramp was very near to the edge looking out<br />
Over the water as blankly as a blind man.<br />
A man! Look at him ... and I a mere cat!<br />
No doubt Old Horton was right.... One leap<br />
Into the darkness and all gloomy thoughts,<br />
All trouble, like the half-finished cigar<br />
Would give place to beautiful dreams and<br />
Never-ending.... At least it cannot be much<br />
Worse.... No! Far better than the foul gutter<br />
And the murderous cravings for the unattainable.<br />
I shall burst my bonds and jump in.</p>

<p class="poem">It gave a terrible fright when I struck<br />
The water. Even in filth and mud I found it more<br />
Pleasure to swim than to drown. How comfortable<br />
The gutter now seemed but my strength was<br />
Utterly useless.... My thoughts had been<br />
Less overwhelming than the murky slime that<br />
Would kill me ... and to sink, to be swallowed<br />
By fishes that had been sweet food for my palate.<br />
A boat came out of the darkness and a brown<br />
Arm folded me up from the last gasp in the river.<br />
It was going out to a yacht and the mate was the<br />
Man who rescued: “What luck with our rats and mice<br />
To find this bedraggled feline.... Maggie can give<br />
It some milk and the Master won’t curse for the<br />
Vermin....”<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Perhaps I was born as an antidote!</span><br />
Perhaps I have no choice what to do!<br />
But whatever may be I shall at least do<br />
What is expected, the best that I can&mdash;<br />
How else can I expect anything?</p>

<p class="poem">Did you ever see a palace in a desert?<br />
Ralph Dimon was a good catch and Irene’s<br />
Father was very rich. Low necked dress,<br />
Dress clothes, lace, jewelry, curtains of<br />
Fine brocade, mahogany panellings and<br />
Nickel-mountings dimmed the lights of Brough’s<br />
Yacht and were more plentiful than the drops<br />
Of water that had nearly drowned me.<br />
As I was lifted over the side I saw the<br />
Two lovers lounging in the bow where there<br />
Were no lights; while inside the electric<br />
Lamps burned neglected. The wind blew a gale<br />
And I shivered; but comfortable surroundings<br />
And even diamonds would warm anybody but a<br />
Half drowned cat....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">I wonder if pink ribbons</span><br />
And a silver-mounted collar would have made<br />
Me warmer or less hungry ... and I was most<br />
Interested because Irene’s father never paid<br />
His bills without a lawsuit.... Perhaps I might<br />
With ribbon and collar have had food for the asking.<br />
But an honest cat must be kicked around<br />
The kitchen by Maggie. Maggie was used to it:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>“Haven’t you better sense than to bring such<br />
Rubbish aboard, Jim? Old Brough will miss the<br />
Milk and there’ll be the devil to pay.”&mdash;And<br />
To think how I could rid this palace of vermin....<br />
But that would cost Father Brough money and<br />
It wouldn’t show....<br />
Jim put me ashore ... but I was grateful!</p>

<p class="poem">What a terrible contrast: from an interrupted<br />
Yachting trip to the garbage can! The smell<br />
Of the sea is sweeter but I wasn’t dressed<br />
For it.... The lure of a square meal is sweeter<br />
Than the glitter of paste.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Think of finding a</span><br />
Half beefsteak on top of the can! There was no<br />
Gravy but it was cooked to perfection. I ate it<br />
With relish, but should have enjoyed it better<br />
If only some one would let me work for it&mdash;<br />
Especially such a meal.... And yet they say beggars<br />
Cannot be choosers.... I found a lot more in the can<br />
To eat, but the steak satisfied me.<br />
I was very tired; so I went to sleep beside the<br />
Can....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the collector came he took counsel of</span><br />
My presence and hunted through to see what he could<br />
Find of value. He looked up and down the street<br />
And then slipped a half-roasted-chicken into his<br />
Blouse; but not before casting me a look of<br />
Triumph.... But I never can eat two meals at a<br />
Sitting and chicken doesn’t agree with me. Then,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Too, even honey is nourishing, but it may give<br />
One indigestion.... I hope he enjoyed the chicken<br />
As much as I did my banquet....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Why, thought I, not</span><br />
Offer to stay in this house where plenty runs<br />
To overflowing....<br />

Shelves were well dusted. I wandered into<br />
The kitchen where oilcloth was spotless<br />
And tidy. Even the walls were fresh-papered....<br />

And his wife, whom they call “tame cat,”<br />
For what seems a fairly long time. Jerry<br />
They call him for short and short is the Bible<br />
He reads. Lovers they are to the world and<br />
To each other still more&mdash;for that is the<br />
Judgment that counts.... Jerry has nights<br />
“At the club” and loves his dear wife’s<br />
Friends. She can always reach him by ’phone<br />
But she wouldn’t do it for worlds as she<br />
Trusts him beyond cavil or guile....<br />
And the tame cat sits on the laps of a<br />
Dozen or more of his friends&mdash;but only<br />
When Jerry is home.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">I followed Jerry one night</span><br />
But his club was not where he went....<br />
We came home exactly at twelve&mdash;and Marion<br />

Fulton had kissed her that night&mdash;and of course<br />
She told Jerry next day.... He trusted his wife<br />
As she him....<br />

Hungered in mind and in body.<br />
Days are not irksome in sunshine<br />
And rain promises more when it ceases.<br />
But the nights are so intimate<br />
And the rays of one’s mind<br />
Are perlucid.<br />
Like a criminal tracing his steps<br />

<p class="poem">Mrs. Horton’s maid, Alice, came home<br />
With the keys. She left the window open<br />
When she went to the corner for food.<br />
I took unfair advantage&mdash;thus experience has taught me&mdash;<br />
Climbed in at the first opportunity.<br />
I hid in her bedroom&mdash;the only door that was open.<br />
After all I had suffered<br />
Perhaps Jack would come back<br />
And then my troubles be over.<br />
For the first time in months<br />
I slept without fear and in comfort....<br />
It must have been after midnight<br />
When Old Horton came in. It was pitch dark<br />
So he couldn’t see me. It gave me uncanny pleasure<br />
To follow him. He stole up to Alice’s room<br />
As if a hundred were watching. The door remained<br />
Gaping to the empty house and&mdash;me.<br />
Presently Alice screamed and the harrowing sound<br />
Frightens me even now.<br />
Horton went back to his room<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>And the house resumed its stillness.<br />
I sat on the floor by his bed<br />
Lulled by his heavy breathing....<br />
Out of the darkness there gleamed<br />
A flash from the crack of a pistol.<br />
Alice was fully dressed and quietly turned on her heel;<br />
Left the house by the basement; walked to the corner<br />
And river; threw something deep in its water; then back<br />
To the house where she’d killed him&mdash;<br />
Leaving the front door open.... I followed her up to her room<br />
Where she undressed and went back to bed....<br />
Dead in his they found Horton,<br />
And on his tomb they inscribed:<br />
<br />
“<span class="smcap">A Loving Father and Devoted Husband</span>.”</p>

Close behind the gleaming arcs of the motor<br />

Edith Horton was one<br />

Mrs. Horton has looked after me.<br />
The day he left<br />
She came to the window<br />
And threw out Old Horton’s boots.<br />
At first I thought they were thrown<br />
At me&mdash;but it seems that she threw them<br />
Wide of the window!<br />
When I voiced my surprise<br />
She hurried to me and now<br />
I sleep on her divan!</p>

Of the other young bloods had a party last night&mdash;<br />
Hunt breakfast they called it, I think.<br />
They started by talking of dogs&mdash;hounds and<br />
Horse-flesh and mounts. I gathered that sort of sport<br />
Leaves all the toil to the dogs<br />

But whether I’ve eaten a fish<br />
Or had just a drink of milk,&mdash;<br />
Only that I found made<br />
A difference.</p>

Patient Stranger!<br />
I’ve told you enough of my<br />
Wanderings.<br />
The Mallorys are troubled with mice<br />
And never close house for the summer!</p>
